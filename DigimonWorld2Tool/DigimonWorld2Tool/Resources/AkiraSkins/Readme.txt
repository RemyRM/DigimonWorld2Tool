To add a new Akira skin create a new folder in the "DigimonWorld2Tool\DigimonWorld2Tool\Resources\AkiraSkins" directory
Give this new folder the name of the skin.
Place the following files in this folder, using the following naming convention:
Akira_{SkinName}.BIN > Model Texture Binary
Akira_{SkinName}_PREVIEW.png > Texture image

Optionally you can add also update the portrait that gets shown when Akira talks by adding the following files:
Akira_{SkinName}_Portrait.BIN > Portrat binary
Akira_{SkinName}_Portrait_PREVIEW.png > Portrait image

To add a preview for the tool to display add a .png following the naming convention:
Akira_{SkinName}_PREVIEW.png

An example of this would be creating a folder "Red", which would contain the files:
Akira_Red.BIN
Akira_Red_Portrait.BIN 
Akira_Red_Portrait_PREVIEW.png 
Akira_Red_PREVIEW.png
