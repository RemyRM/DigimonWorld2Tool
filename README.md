# DigimonWorld2Visualizer

Work in progress visualizer for the map data of the game "Digimon World 2".

# Roadmap

Functionality I may or may not add at some point in the future, in semi order of relevance (subject to change and my motivation):
- Map layout editor
- Map layout randomizer
- Map object editor
- Map object randomizer
- A*/Dijkstra algorithm to find best routes
- 3D model extractor/viewer
- 3D model injector (add your own digimon!)
- Sprite/texture extractor/viewer
- Sprite/texture editor/injector

# Build steps

- Create a directory called "Maps" in your `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory` directory (e.g. DigimonWorld2MapVisualizer\DigimonWorld2MapVisualizer\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\Maps`)
- Add the binary files for the maps you want to be able to view to the \Maps\ directory (e.g. "DUNG4000.BIN")
- Launch the application from your IDE or build the application
