# DigimonWorld2 Tool

Work in progress tool to inspect and mod Digimon World 2 files.

# Current functionality
The tool can currently read in the following data files to use in visualization:
- MODELDT0
- DIGIMNDT
- ENEMYSET
- ITEMDATA

The tool will try to visualize any file found in the set directory, the standard dungeon layout files can be found in `\AAA\4.AAA\DUNG\DUNG` and are named DUNGxxxx.BIN.
Digimon, Warps, Treasures and Traps are all visualized and can be clicked for detailed information. Digimon sets can be further inspected to see their stats.

# Roadmap

Functionality I may or may not add at some point in the future, in semi order of relevance (subject to change and my motivation):
- Texture visualizer
- Map editor
- 3D model extractor/viewer
- 3D model injector (add your own digimon!)
- Texture editor/injector
